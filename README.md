## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

A great way to make responsive layouts with CSS Grid without having to worry, is using `grid-template-areas`. Laying them out top to bottom on mobile devices and automatically switching it to side-by-side is really easy.

```html
<div class="wrapper">
  <div class="section-1"></div>
  <div class="section-2"></div>
  <div class="section-3"></div>
</div>
```

```css
.wrapper {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-areas:
    'section-1'
    'section-2'
    'section-3';
}

.section-1 {
  grid-area: section-1;
}

.section-2 {
  grid-area: section-2;
}

.section-3 {
  grid-area: section-3;
}

@media screen and (min-width: 1000px) {
  .wrapper {
    grid-template-areas: 'section-1 section-2 section-3';
  }
}
```
